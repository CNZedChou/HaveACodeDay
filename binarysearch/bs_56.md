## Idea

- [1] The rolling formula of two variables has to be calculated later, a represents the n−1th term, and b represents the nth term.
Then let c=a+b represent the n+1th item, and then let a and b move backward one place in sequence.

### Implementation - 1

- Complexity：
  - Time O(N)
  - Space O(1)

``` c++
int solve(int n) {
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    while (n --) {
        int c = (a + b) % mod;
        a = b, b = c;
    }
    return a ;
}
// Zed Chou
