# Have A Code Day
Consider an angle. At the point the lines originate the distance between them is fairly small. Extrapolate those lines and the further you get away from the originating point the distance between those lines grows. Nudge one line out further and the distance grows, negligible at first but the further away from that center point the distance is even greater.
